What is Retentioneering?
========================

Retentioneering Tools is a Python framework to process and analyze clickstreams,
event streams, trajectories, and event logs. You can segment users, clients (agents),
build ML pipelines to predict agent category or probability of target event based
on historical data.

Retentioneering extends Pandas, NetworkX, Scikit-learn for in-depth processing
of event sequences data, specifically Retentioneering provides a powerful
environment to perform an in-depth analysis of customer journey maps, bringing
behavior-driven segmentation of users and machine learning pipelines to product analytics.

Product analysts can apply Retentioneering Tools as a Python framework
to explore, grow, and optimize the product based on deep analysis of user
trajectories. Using Retentioneering you can vectorize clickstream logs and cluster
user trajectories to automatically identify common successful or churn patterns.
You can explore those patterns using our tools such as graph visualizer,
step matrix, multiple clustering, and segmentation engines, and many others.

If you use Pandas dataframes to work with user behaviour data you can try
Retentioneering with a few lines of code.
